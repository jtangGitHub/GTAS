Meetings Minutes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Where: 557C
When: June 4, 2015, 11 - 11:45am
Attendees: Brian Dolbeare, Lola Adebiyi, Jeen Tang, Amit Bandopadhay, (Brian's colleague from the adjacent desk, also attended)
Minutes:
Brian demonstrated the UDR management UI. The rules are represented as hierarchical structures in XML.
The rules are versioned.
The rule lifecycle includes states such as:
created -> Approved -> Activated
From the activated state rules can be removed and archived, or suspended (suspended rules need approval before re-activation).
Created rules can also be deleted.
Default period of validity is 3 years.

The rule engine is a standalone service with its own WAR.
The service is stateless. However the rules are compiled and cached by the service.
Every five minutes there is a scheduled invocation of a rule refresh cycle where all current rules (including newly activated ones)
are obtained from the DB, compiled and cached.

Request processing in the service includes the following steps:
1. Create a rule engine sesssion with the cached compiled rules.
2. Read the Target Object (TO) data from the DB and flatten them into BO lists and insert into the working memory.
3. Fire rules.
4. Convert results into TO and return results.

Brian said that they do not use the Rule Repository and maanagement used by JBoss (i.e., Guvnor), since they did not want
to be tied to JBoss release schedules and conversion requirements from version to version.

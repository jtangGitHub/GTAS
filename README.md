# GTAS README

## About GTAS
The Global Travel Assessment System (GTAS) is a turn-key web application that provides all the necessary decision support system features to (1) receive and store air traveler data, both Advance Passenger Information (API) and PNR (Passenger Name Record); (2) provide real-time risk assessment against this data based on your own specific risk criteria and/or watch lists; and (3) view high risk travelers as well as their associated flight and reservation information.

## About the code
GTAS is developed in Java and uses open source software components and platforms.

## About the data
GTAS parses data provided by airline departure control systems (API) and reservation systems (PNR). Respectively, these messages conform to WCO UN/EDIFACT Passenger (PAXLST V3.0) and PNRGOV (V13.1) message formats.
